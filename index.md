title: A course on combinatorial species
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

Combinatorial species provide a categorical foundation for enumerative combinatorics. Nowadays they find application in combinatorics, algebra (where they provide an axiomatisation for the notion of *algebraic theory* Ã  la Lawvere), algebraic topology (where they provide a foundation for the theory of operads), computer science (containers, etc.) and many other areas of pure Mathematics.

Combinatorial species are a true mathematical gem; they elegantly tie together a disparate variety of objects naturally arising in everyday mathematical practice.

Combinatorial species were invented by A. Joyal. After that, entire books have been written on the topic: among these, we will often refer to two

1. The red book
2. The big book

This website is the logbook of a reading seminar that I would like to start at [taltech](https://compose.ioc.ee) during Fall 2021.
