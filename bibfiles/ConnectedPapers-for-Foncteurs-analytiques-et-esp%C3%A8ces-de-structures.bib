abstract = {Abstract Using the combinatorial techniques developed by Barcelo and Bergeron, we construct a Bn-module, called L (n), related to the Orlik-Solomon algebra of the hyperoctahedral hyperplane complements lattice (os(Bn)) [10, 13]. The Bn-modules L (n) and os(Bn) are analogous to the modules for the symmetric group which occur in the context of the free Lie algebra and the partition lattice. In particular we show that the module L (n) is the transpose of the module os(Bn) tensored by a sign representation. As a by-product we show that the action of Bn on a natural basis of L (n) is block triangular. The blocks are indexed by the conjugacy classes of Bn and have dimension equal to the number of elements in such a class. We also compute the characters of this action restricted to each block.},

abstract = {The combinatorial theory of species, introduced by Joyal in 1980, provides a unified understanding of the use of generating functions for both labelled and unlabelled structures and as a tool for the specification and analysis of these structures. Of particular importance is their capacity to transform recursive definitions of tree-like structures into functional or differential equations, and vice versa. The goal of this book is to present the basic elements of the theory and to give a unified account of its developments and applications. It offers a modern introduction to the use of various generating functions, with applications to graphical enumeration, Polya theory and analysis of data structures in computer science, and to other areas such as special functions, functional equations, asymptotic analysis and differential equations. This book will be a valuable reference to graduate students and researchers in combinatorics, analysis, and theoretical computer science.},

abstract = {Abstract Let P be a finite poset and G a group of automorphisms of P. The action of G on P can be used to define various linear representations of G, and we investigate how these representations are related to one another and to the structure of P. Several examples are analyzed in detail, viz., the symmetric group G n acting on a boolean algebra, GLn(q) acting on subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over GF(q), the hyperoctahedral group Bn acting on the lattice of faces of a cross-polytope, and G n acting on the lattice Πn of partitions of an n-set. Several results of a general nature are also proved. These include a duality theorem related to Alexander duality, a special property of geometric lattices, the behavior of barycentric subdivision, and a method for showing that certain sequences are unimodal. In particular, we give what seems to be the simplest proof to date that the q-binomial coefficient k+l k has unimodal coefficients.},

abstract = {The general aim of this talk is to advocate a combinatorial perspective, together with its methods, in the investigation and study of models of computation structures. This, of course, should be taken in conjunction with the well-established views and methods stemming from algebra, category theory, domain theory, logic, type theory, etc. In support of this proposal I will show how such an approach leads to interesting connections between various areas of computer science and mathematics; concentrating on one such example in some detail. Specifically, I will consider the line of my research involving denotational models of the pi calculus and algebraic theories with variable-binding operators, indicating how the abstract mathematical structure underlying these models fits with that of Joyal's combinatorial species of structures. This analysis suggests both the unification and generalisation of models, and in the latter vein I will introduce generalised species of structures and their calculus. These generalised species encompass and generalise various of the notions of species used in combinatorics. Furthermore, they have a rich mathematical structure (akin to models of Girard's linear logic) that can be described purely within Lawvere's generalised logic. Indeed, I will present and treat the cartesian closed structure, the linear structure, the differential structure, etc. of generalised species axiomatically in this mathematical framework. As an upshot, I will observe that the setting allows for interpretations of computational calculi (like the lambda calculus, both typed and untyped; the recently introduced differential lambda calculus of Ehrhard and Regnier; etc) that can be directly seen as translations into a more basic elementary calculus of interacting agents that compute by communicating and operating upon structured data.},

abstract = {Abstract Let G be a finite group, n a positive integer, Q n ( G ) the Dowling lattice of rank n based on G and W n the wreath product group G wr S n . It is easily seen that W n acts as a group of automorphisms of Q n ( G ). This action lifts to a representation of W n on each homology group of Q n ( G ). The character values of these representations are computed. Let σ be an element of W n . Consider σ as an n × n permutation matrix σ whose nonzero entries have been replaced by elements of G . If C is a cycle of σ, the weight of C is the product of the elements of G which lie in the cycle C . The type of C is the conjugacy class of G containing the weight of C . Let c l , u denote the number of l -cycles of σ of type u . The conjugacy class of σ in W n depends only on the numbers c l , u . For each i = 0, 1,…, n − 1 let ( Q n ( G )) i be the geometric lattice obtained from Q n ( G ) by deleting ranks i + 1 through n − 1 (so ( Q n ( G )) n − 1 = Q n ( G )). Let β i denote the character of the representation of W n on the unique non-vanishing reduced homology group of Q n ( G )) i . For each σ ϵ W n , let B σ ( λ ) be the polynomial B σ ( λ ) = ∑ i = 0 n − 1 β i ( σ )) λ n − 1 − i . It is shown that B 0 (λ)=(−1) n ∏ l,u C l,u !(l|C G (u)|) cl,u λ+1 F(l,u, l) − C l,u F(l,u,−λ) where F(l, u, λ) = ( −1 l¦G¦ ) ∑ t¦l b(t,u) μ(t) λ l t , and where b(t, u) is the number of solutions h ϵ G to h t = u . The formula (∗) allows for the explicit computation of the characters β i . Using this information, several facts about the characters are deduced. For example, it is shown that the trivial character appears exactly once in each β i and it is shown that β n − 1 can be realized in a simple way as a sum of induced characters.},

There is a bijection Φ between the set of transitive actions (up to isomorphism) of Sn on finite sets and the set of “molecular” species of degree n (up to isomorphism). This bijection extends to a ring isomorphism between B(Sn) (the Burnside ring of the symmetric group) and the ring V S n (of virtual species of degree n).Since permutation groups are well known (and often studied using computers) this helps in finding examples and counterexamples in species. The cycle index series of a molecular species, which is hard to compute directly, is proved to be simply the (Polya) cycle polynomial of the corresponding permutation group. Conversely, several operations which are hard to define in ΠnB(Sn) have a natural description in terms of species. Both situations are extended to coefficients in λ-rings and binomial rings in the last section.},

A permutation σ acts on words by replacing each occurrence of the letter a i by a σ i . This action linearly extends to LIE[ A ]. We are concerned here with the action of the symmetric group S n on the subspace of LIE[ A ] which is the linear span of bracketings of words which are permutations of the letters of the alphabet. It follows from the work of Hanlon, Stanley, and Joyal that this action and the action of S n on the top homology of the partition lattice Π n induce similar representations (up to tensoring with the alternating character). It follows from the work of Garsia and Stanton that the action on the homology is similar to the action on a suitably defined top portion of the Stanley-Reisner ring. In this paper we derive a direct combinatorial proof of the similarity of these three actions by choosing natural bases in each of these three spaces and comparing the matrices corresponding to the simple reflections.},

abstract = {Several representations of the symmetric group, arising from different combinatorial, algebraic and geometric constructions, have lead to the same character, up to multiplication by the sign character: the homology of partition lattice (cf. [5, 7, 13]), the top component of a special quotient of the Stanley-Reisner ring of this same lattice [4], the top component of the cohomology algebra of the variety {x ~ C n [ x~ ~ x j if i # j } computed by Arnold [9], the free Lie algebra [7, 8]. Barcelo [1] and Bergeron and Barcelo [2] have also proved this equality of characters by showing that the matrices of these representations in the classical bases (Lyndon basis of the free Lie algebra, Garsia-Stanton basis, NBC basis of Bj6rner [3]) are equal, up to sign-character and transposition. The latter work has been the starting motivation of the present paper. It turns out that the character of Sn acting on the (multilinear part of the) free Lie algebra is the product by the sign character by its character on the (oddly generated) free Lie superalgebra R(X). This fact is already implicit in Ree's paper [12]. In the present paper, we give several combinatorial/algebraic constructions (analytic functors [7], or polynomial functors [10]) which are variant of the classical construction of T~(X) by trees (representing the brackets) or of its dual; these different functors coincide in their multilinear part with the previously mentioned constructions on the partition lattice, so that the equality of characters and matrices becomes natural. A striking fact in all these constructions is that they are obtained by introducing relations which in all cases are of two kinds: one of length 2, and one of length 3 (antisymmetry and Jacobi identity for the free Lie superalgebra, cohomology or Garsia-Stanton relations in the Stanley-Reisner ring, antisymmetry and cyclicity in the Arnold algebra).

We compute the Mobius function in each case. These three incidence algebras are the linear duals of incidence bialgebras arising, respectively, from the classes of transversals of partitions (with an order that we define), partitions compatible with permutations (with the usual refinement order), and linear transversals of linear partitions (with the order induced by that on transversals). We define notions of morphisms between partitions, permutations and linear partitions, respectively, whose kernels are defined to be, in each case, transversals, compatible partitions and linear transversals. We introduce, in each case, a pair of sequences of polynomials in x of binomial type, counting morphisms and monomorphisms, and obtain expressions for their connection constants, by summation and Mobius inversion over the corresponding posets of kernels.},

abstract = {For a fixed positive integer k, consider the collection of all affine hyperplanes in n-space given by xi − xj = m, where i, j ∈ [n], i ≠ j, and m ∈ {0, 1,..., k}. Let Ln,k be the set of all nonempty affine subspaces (including the empty space) which can be obtained by intersecting some subset of these affine hyperplanes. Now give Ln,k a lattice structure by ordering its elements by reverse inclusion. The symmetric group Gn acts naturally on Ln,k by permuting the coordinates of the space, and this action extends to an action on the top homology of Ln,k. It is easy to show by computing the character of this action that the top homology is isomorphic as an Gn-module to a direct sum of copies of the regular representation, CGn. In this paper, we construct an explicit basis for the top homology of Ln,k, where the basis elements are indexed by all labelled, rooted, (k + 1)-ary trees on n-vertices in which the root has no 0-child. This construction gives an explicit Gn-equivariant isomorphism between the top homology of Ln,k and a direct sum of copies of CGn.},

A categorical approach is used to formulate it. A new proof of Cayley's formula for the number of labelled trees is given as well as a new combinatorial proof (due to G. Labelle) of Lagrange's inversion formula. Polya's enumeration theory of isomorphism classes of structures is entirely renewed. Recursive methods for computing cycle index polynomials are described. A combinatorial version of the implicit function theorem is stated and proved. The paper ends with general considerations on the use of coalgebras in combinatorics.},

abstract = {Abstract Let f = f(x) = x + a2x2 + … ∈ K[[x]] be a “normalized” power series over a (commutative) field K of characteristic zero. The operator Δf: K[[x]] → K[[x]], defined by Δfg = g ∘ f − g, has been used in ( G. Labelle, European J. Combin. 1 (1980) , 113–138) to obtain formulas for the inverse f〈−1〉 and the generalized iterates f〈t〉, t ∈ K, of the series f. A. Joyal (in Lect. Notes in Math. Vol. 1234, pp. 126–159, Springer-Verlag, New York/Berlin, 1986 ) was the first to realize that Δf can be lifted to the combinatorial level. He made use of this fact to obtain a formula for a virtual species F〈−1〉 which is the inverse (under substitution) of any given normalized species F = X + …. Using the same operator, we show that the concept of K -species in the sense of Y.-N. Yeh (ibid.) (where K is now only a binomial half-ring) is a good context for the definition of the generalized iterates F〈t〉, t ∈ K, of any normalized species (or K -species). We present a new approach to Yeh's extension of substitution to K -species. We also introduce the notions of “infinitesimal generator,” “directional derivatives,” and “Lie bracket” of K -species, which turn out to be K -species, where K denotes the “rational closure” of K . These concepts give, in return, a better insight into substitution itself. For example, G ∘ F can be written in the form G ∘ F = (exp DΦ)G for a suitably chosen derivation DΦ. More generally, G ∘ F〈t〉 = (exp tDΦ)G. Two normalized K -species commute under substitution if and only if the Lie bracket of their infinitesimal generators is zero. Explicitly computed examples are also given.},

abstract = {Given an alphabet A = {a1, a2 … an}, the smallest subspace of the linear space of A-words, which contains the words of length one and is closed under the bracket operation [f, g] = fg – fg, is usually referred to as the Free Lie Algebra over A. This is an ubiquitous mathematical tool which has been studied by researchers from quite different points of views. It may also be studied as a purely combinatorial object. In this paper we show that a number of classical results concerning the Free Lie Algebra are intimately related to and may be derived from the study of certain permutation statistics. Taking this approach establishes a remarkable link between the Free Lie Algebra and some recent research in combinatorics. The paper systematically explores this connection by developing the whole theory from the combinatorial point of view. Connections with the Representation Theory of the Symmetric and General Linear groups are also studied.},

As an application we are able to describe the free part of the cohomology of the quotient space MA4IG. Our motivating examples are arrangements in Cn that are invariant under the action of Sn by permuting coordinates. A particular case is the "k-equal" arrangement, first studied by Bj6rner, Lovasz, and Yao motivated by questions in complexity theory. In these cases MA4 and MA/Sn are spaces of ordered and unordered point configurations in Cn many of whose properties are reduced by our formulas to combinatorial questions in partition lattices. More generally, we treat point configurations in Rd and provide explicit results for the "k-equal" and the "k-divisible" cases.},

abstract = {Abstract A descent class, in the symmetric group Sn, is the collection of permutations with a given descent set. It was shown by L. Solomon (J. Algebra41 (1976), 255–264) that the product (in the group algebra Q(Sn)) of two descent classes is a linear combination of descent classes. Thus descent classes generate a subalgebra of Q(Sn). We refer to it here as Solomon's descent algebra and denote it by Σn. This algebra is not semisimple but it has a faithul representation in terms of upper triangular matrices. The main goal of this paper is a decomposition of its multiplicative structure. It develops that Σn acts in a natural way on the so-called Lie monomials. This action has a purely combinatorial description and is a crucial tool in the construction of a complete set of indecomposable representations of Σn. In particular we obtain a natural basis of irreducible orthogonal idempotents Σλ (indexed by partitions of n) for the quotient Σ n √Σ n . Natural bases of nilpotents and idempotents for the subspaces EλΣnEμ, for two arbitrary partitions λ and μ, are also constructed and the dimensions of these spaces are given a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the so-called decreasing factorization of an arbitary word into a product of Lyndon words.},
