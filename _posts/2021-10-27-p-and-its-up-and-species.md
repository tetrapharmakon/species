The fundamental object of study of the theory of combinatorial species is the category $\bf P$ of finite sets and bijections, and its presheaf category $[{\bf P}^\text{op}, {\bf Set}]$. (Note: due to the fact that a groupoid is a self-dual category, there isn't  much difference between $[{\bf P}^\text{op}, {\bf Set}]$ and $[{\bf P}, {\bf Set}]$, but we will usually speak about the first category.)

### The groupoid of natural numbers

**Definition** (The category $\bf P$).

**Remark** (On the structure of $\bf P$).

**Corollary.** A functor $X : {\bf P} \to {\bf Set}$ is just...

**Theorem.** The universal property of $\bf P$ as the free symmetric monoidal category on a singleton

### Monoidal structure on $\bf P$

**Definition** (The Cartesian monoidal structure).

**Definition** (The Cauchy monoidal structure).

**Definition** (The substitution monoidal structure).
