    <h1>An application of species to functional programming</h1>
    <p>One of the many ways of formally describing a programming language is via <em>denotational semantics</em>, in which a term $T$ of type $\tau$ is represented by a mathematical object $\llbracket T \rrbracket \in \llbracket\tau\rrbracket$ (its <em>denotation</em>), where $\llbracket\tau\rrbracket$ is a <em>domain</em>, a certain kind of structured set. Terms of type $\sigma\to\tau$ are then interpreted as suitable functions $\llbracket\sigma\rrbracket\to\llbracket\tau\rrbracket$ between domains.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>(Thanks to <a href="">dpl0a</a> for having written this introduction replacing my lazy fat fingers.)</p>

<p>In this sense, a certain subcategory of the category of analytic functors (the category of normal functors) is a denotational semantics for a certain flavour of $\lambda$-calculus.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (Analytic functor in more than one variable). Let $A$ be a set and $F : \mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}$ a functor ($\mathbf{Set}^A$ is equivalently the product category $\prod_{a\in A}\mathbf{Set}$ and the slice category $\mathbf{Set}/A$; we will make constant use of this equivalence).</p>

<p>We define an <em>analytic functor in $A$ variables</em> as a functor $F$ that results from the left Kan extension of a <em>species in $A$ variables</em> along the obvious functor $\mathbf{P}^A =\prod_{a\in A}\mathbf{P}\to \mathbf{Set}^A$;</p>

<p>[diag]</p>

<p>Given two sets $A$ and $B$, we define an analytic functor $\mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}^B$ as a $B$-indexed family of analytic functors $F_b : \mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}$; this is motivated by the chain of isomorphisms</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\textstyle \mathsf{Cat}(\mathbf{Set}^A,\mathbf{Set}^B) \cong \mathsf{Cat}(\mathbf{Set}^A \times B,\mathbf{Set}) \cong \prod_{b\in B}\mathsf{Cat}(\mathbf{Set}^A,\mathbf{Set})
$$</div>

<p>so every property asked to a functor $\mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}^B$ boils down to a property asked to a $B$-indexed family of functors $\mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The category of normal analytic functors). A functor $F : \mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}$ is called <em>normal analytic</em> if it is analytic and results as a coproduct of representables over finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf{Set}^A$; this means that there exists a canonical way to decompose $F$ as $\sum_{i\in I} \mathbf{Set}^A(X_i,-)$, where $X_i$ is a finite set for every $i\in I$ (while there is no restriction on the cardinality of $I$).</p>

<p>A NAF $\mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}^B$ is defined as a $B$-indexed family of NAFs $F_b : \mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}$. We define the category $\mathsf{NAF}$ of normal analytic functors having</p>

<ul>
  <li>objects the categories $\mathbf{Set}^A, \mathbf{Set}^B,\dots$;</li>
  <li>morphisms the NAFs $\mathbf{Set}^A \to \mathbf{Set}^B$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be promoted to a 2-category taking natural transformations between NAFs as 2-cells, but the choice of which transformations are admissible, in the sense that they preserve analiticity, is a subtle issue. In order for some results to be true, the class of transformations $F \Rightarrow G$ between two NAFs has to be restricted (taking for example only the <em>cartesian</em> natural transformations), collapsed (identifying two natural transformations under a certain equivalence relation), or both.</p>

<p>Now, let’s observe that there is an alternative description of NAFs as “the opposite category of sets” up to equivalence; this result is rooted in a rather deep variety theorem for categories generated under coproducts.</p>

<p>A <em>complete atomic accessible category</em> is a category $\mathcal C$ with finite limits and small
coproducts that are disjoint and universal, C being subject to the condition
that</p>

<p>(i) the lattice Sub(1) of the subobjects of a terminal object 1 is small, and
(ii) every object is a coproduct of atomic elements (“atoms” for short) in the lattice Sub(1). From this it follows that the lattice Sub(1) is a complete atomic Boolean algebra.</p>

<p>This is sufficient to see that a CAAC $\mathcal C$ is equivalent to the free coproduct completion of its set of atoms $A(\mathcal C)$. Since for a discrete category the coproduct completion coincides with the free cocompletion, the canonical functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}^{A(\mathcal C)}$ is an equivalence if and only if $\mathcal C$ is a CAAC.</p>

<p>This is sufficient to deduce</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (NAF as $\mathbf{Set}^\text{op}$). There is an equivalence of categories between $\mathsf{CAAC}$ and $\mathbf{Set}^\text{op}$, determined identifying a set $A$ with its presheaf category, and a CAAC with the set/lattice of its atoms.</p>

<p>In particular, the category of CAACs is cartesian closed:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Cartesian closure of NAAC).</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>.</p>

<p>The $\lambda$-calculus we are interested in is called <em>PCF</em>. Like all $\lambda$-calculi, PCF xtends the bare $\lambda$-calculus given by the BNF specification</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
T ::= x \mid T\, T \mid \lambda x.T
$$</div>

<p>The $\lambda$-calculus we want to study is typed (of course), so we have to specify both types and terms having those types:</p>

<p>For what concerns types,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sigma ::= \iota \mid o \mid \sigma \Rightarrow\sigma
$$</div>

<p>where $\iota$ is regarded as the type of natural numbers, and $o$ as a type of Boolean values. For what concerns terms,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{rcl} M & ::= & x \\
   && \mid M\, M \\
   && \mid \lambda x^\sigma.M \\
   && \mid \text{fix } M \\
   && \mid \text{suc } M \\
   && \mid \text{pred } M \\
   && \mid \text{zero? } M \\
   && \mid \text{if } M \text{ then } M \text{ else } M \\
   && \mid t \\
   && \mid f \\
   && \mid n
   \end{array}
$$</div>

<p>In this list $x$ is a variable from a fixed (unnamed) countable set, $n$ is a natural number, $\text{fix } M$ is the <em>fixpoint</em> of a term $M$, $\text{suc}$ and $\text{pred}$ behave like the successor and predecessor functions ver natural numbers, $\text{zero?}$ is a test: it returns $t$ if the number is not equal to zero, and $f$ otherwise (so, obviously, ${t,f}$ is a set of truth values). Finally, we have and if-then-else construct.</p>

<p>Thanks to the above theorem we can interpret the category of NAFs as the opposite of the category of sets. Thus, when looking for a denotational semantics for PCF we can interpret types and terms as if they were sets.</p>

<p>In particular, types are interpreted as sets by the following definition:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{c}
\llbracket \iota \rrbracket := \omega \\[.5em]
\llbracket o \rrbracket := \{0,1\} \\[.5em]
\llbracket \sigma \Rightarrow \tau \rrbracket := \exp \llbracket \sigma\rrbracket \times \llbracket \tau\rrbracket \\
\end{array}
$$</div>

<p>where $\exp \llbracket \sigma \rrbracket$ is the result of applying the analytic functor of multisets to the object $\llbracket \sigma \rrbracket$.</p>

<p>For the interpretation of a term, we de*ne it on correct typing judgments as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\Gamma = x_1^{\sigma_1}, \dots, x_n^{\sigma_n} \vdash M : \tau
$$</div>

<p>The interpretation $\llbracket M \rrbracket_{\vec x}$ is a normal functor $\mathbf{Set}^{A_1+\dots+A_n} \to \mathbf{Set}^B$ where $A_i = \llbracket \sigma_i\rrbracket$ and $B = \llbracket \tau \rrbracket$. This definition is by induction on construction of terms. What is the most interesting is the interpretation of the fixpoint combinator. But we start with easy ones.</p>

<p>We interpret</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$\lambda$ terms as</p>

    <div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{c}
\llbracket x_i\rrbracket_{\vec x}(\vec t) = t_i \\[.5em]
\llbracket M\, N\rrbracket_{\vec x}(\vec t) = \text{ev}(\llbracket M\rrbracket_{\vec x}, \llbracket N\rrbracket_{\vec x}) \\[.5em]
\llbracket \lambda y^\sigma.M\rrbracket_{\vec x}(\vec t) = \Lambda(\llbracket M\rrbracket_{\vec x,y}(\vec t,-))
\end{array}
$$</div>

    <p>where $\text{ev}$ and $\Lambda$ are respectively evaluation and currying of the cartesian closed structure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arithmetic and Boolean operations as</p>

    <div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{c}
\llbracket t\rrbracket = \{1\}, \qquad \llbracket f\rrbracket = \{0\} \\[.5em]
\llbracket \text{suc}\rrbracket : [\{n\}, n+1] \mapsto 1 \\[.5em]
\llbracket \text{pred}\rrbracket : [\{n+1\}, n] \mapsto 1 \\[.5em]
\llbracket \text{pred}\rrbracket : [\{0\}, 0] \mapsto 1
\end{array}
$$</div>

    <p>and zero otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The $\text{zero?}$ test as</p>

    <div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{c}
\llbracket \text{zero?}\rrbracket : [\{n+1\}, 1] \mapsto 1 \\[.5em]
\llbracket \text{zero?}\rrbracket : [\{0\}, 0] \mapsto 1 \\[.5em]
\end{array}
$$</div>

    <p>and zero otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The if-then-else construct as the functor $\mathbf{Set}^{\exp 2\times \exp A \times \exp A \times A} \to \mathbf{Set}$, sending $({1}, {a}, _, a)$ and $({0}, _, {a}, a)$ to $1$, and assuming the value $\varnothing$ elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the fixpoint operation $\text{fix}$ is interpreted as an initial algebra construction: …I could transcribe Hasegawa, but what for?</p>
