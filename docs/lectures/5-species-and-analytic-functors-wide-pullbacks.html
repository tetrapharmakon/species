    <h1>Species and analytic functors</h1>
    <p>This chapter embarks on a more category-theoretic study of species. Every species has a canonical decomposition as an infinite sum $f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + \dots$ and it gives rise to an endofunctor $\bar F $ of $\bf Set$ that admits a “Taylor expansion”.</p>

<p>Such functors are called <em>analytic</em>, and they can be characterised intrisically as the finitary endofunctors of $\bf Set$ satisfying a weak exactness property.</p>

<h3 id="analytic-functors-wide-pullbacks">Analytic functors, wide pullbacks</h3>

<p><strong>Construction.</strong> Given a combinatorial species $f : {\bf P} \to \bf Set$, we can consider the left Kan extension</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.0ex 0.0ex -1.729ex 0.0ex; height: 3.458ex; width: 5.032ex;' src="/species/antex/7ce92dcf0301e25b493a4c7c6fedb212.svg" /></span></p>

<p>and $FX$ can be computed as the coend</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
X\mapsto \int^n f(n)\times X^n
$$</div>

<p>such a functor is called <em>analytic</em>, and in fact we call in this way every functor that lies in the image of the functor $\text{Lan}_J$, where $J : {\bf P} \hookrightarrow {\bf Set}$ is the (nonfull) inclusion functor. It is then evident that $\text{Lan}_J$ is the left adjoint in a pair</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\text{Lan}_J :  {\bf Spc} \leftrightarrows [{\bf Set}, {\bf Set}] : J^*.
$$</div>

<p>Since $J$ is not fully faithful, the category of combinatorial species cannot be seen as a full subcategory of endofunctors of $\bf Set$ subject to some additional property prescribed by the coreflection $J^*$.</p>

<p>Its essential image is thus a little bit more difficult to characterise than in the case of $[{\bf Fin}, {\bf Set}]$ examined in lecture 1.</p>

<p>With a little bit more effort, we can however characterise such an essential image as the subcategory of those $F : {\bf Set} \to {\bf Set}$ such that</p>

<ol>
  <li>$F$ is finitary;</li>
  <li>$F$ weakly preserves wide pullbacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second condition deserves more explanation, but first a bit of history. This equivalence was first showed by Joyal in his “<em>Foncteurs analytiques</em>”; the proof of the equivalence will occupy the entire lecture, and it comes from a more modern presentation of this idea in Adamek-Velebil that is purely elementary, in the sense that it relies on elementary category theory and it is quite straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> An endofunctor $F : {\bf Set} \to {\bf Set}$ is said to <em>weakly preserve pullbacks</em> if for every pullback square</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.0ex 0.0ex -1.729ex 0.0ex; height: 3.458ex; width: 5.032ex;' src="/species/antex/7ce92dcf0301e25b493a4c7c6fedb212.svg" /></span></p>

<p>the canonical map $F(A\times_C B) \to FA \times_{FC} FB$ is surjective.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $E$ be a set and $\cal C$ a category; a <em>($E$-ary) wide pullback</em> with sink $X \in \cal C$ is the limit of a diagram $E \to {\cal C}/X$ where $E$ is regarded as a discrete category and ${\cal C}/X$ is the slice of $\cal C$ over $X$.</p>

<p>In simple terms, a wide pullback is a pullback having possibly more than two arrows pointing to the same object. In more obscure terms, let $E$ be a set, and let $E^\rhd$ be the category where a distinguished new object $\infty$ has be forcefully rendered a terminal object; a $E$-ary wide pullback in $\cal C$ is a limit of a diagram $E^\rhd \to \cal C$.</p>
