    <h1>Monoidal Structures on P</h1>
    <p>A fundamental tenet of categorical combinatorics is that the richness of the objects it tries to study (“combinatorial objects”, broadly intended) comes from the synergy between many different structures one can equip the categories meant to describe said combinatorial objects.</p>

<h3 id="monoidal-structure-on-bf-p-and-bf-spc">Monoidal structure on $\bf P$ and $\bf Spc$</h3>

<p>In particular, there are three distinct <em>monoidal structures</em> on the category of species, all of which have a quite natural combinatorial interpretation. One of them is the most important for us because it is induced on $\bf Spc$ by a natural choice of a monoidal product on $\bf P$. The monoidal structure on $\bf P$ is essentially determined by the disjoint sum of finite set: in a skeleton for $\bf P$, $[n]\cup [m] = [n+m]$. This operation induces a <em>convolution</em> operation on $\bf Spc$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The “sum and shuffle” product on $\bf P$). The “sum and shuffle” monoidal structure $\oplus$ on $\bf P$ is the bifunctor $\_\oplus_ : {\bf P} \times {\bf P} \to \bf P$ defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on objects, $[n]\oplus [m]$ is just the set $[n+m]$;</li>
  <li>on morphisms, let’s say $\sigma : [n] \to [n]$ and $\eta [m] \to [m]$ are two bijections, the bijection $∑ \oplus \eta$ is defined as a “shuffle permutation”, namely</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sigma \oplus \eta : i \mapsto \begin{cases} \sigma i & \text{ if } 1 \le i \le  n \\ \eta(i-n) & \text{ if } n+1 \le i \le n+m \end{cases}
$$</div>

<p>In simple terms, this means that a permutation of $n$ elements and a permutation of $m$ elements act “in parallel” on a set with $n+m$ elements. (Exercise: write $\sigma \oplus \eta : [6] \to [6]$ when $n=m=3$, $\sigma = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\eta = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The Cartesian monoidal structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>Cartesian product</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \times Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto X[n] \times Y[n]
$$</div>

<p>It can be easily checked that $(X\times Y)_\bullet$ is the binary product bifunctor in $\bf Spc$. (Evidently: because limits, and <em>a fortiori</em> products, in a category of functors, are computed pointwise.)</p>

<p>In terms of their formal power series representation, the product corresponds to the pointwise (or “Hadamard”) product of formal power series: given $f,g : \mathbb N \llbracket t\rrbracket$, $f\times g$ is the series</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (f_ng_n) t^n.
$$</div>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The coCartesian structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>coproduct</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \cup Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto X[n] \cup Y[n]
$$</div>

<p>where $\cup$ denotes the disjoint union of sets. It can be easily checked that $(X\cup Y)_\bullet$ is the binary coproduct bifunctor in $\bf Spc$. (Evidently: because colimits, and <em>a fortiori</em> coproducts, in a category of functors, are computed pointwise.)</p>

<p>In terms of their formal power series representation, the product corresponds to the plain <em>sum</em> of formal power series.</p>

<p>In order to introduce the next construction, we need the following definition: let $X,Y$ be two sets on which a group $G$ is acting, respectively on the right and on the left.</p>

<p>We define the <em>equivariant product</em> $X\otimes_G Y$ of $X$ and $Y$ to be the set obtained as the coequaliser of the pair of maps</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.021ex 0.115ex -3.658ex 0.0ex; height: 7.679ex; width: 49.225ex;' src="/species/antex/f3efa0c778769de945df615a078313c2.svg" /></span></p>

<p>where $\alpha : X \times G \to X$ and $\beta : G \times Y \to Y$ are the actions.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The Cauchy monoidal structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>Cauchy product</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \cdot Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto \sum_{p+q=n} X[p] \otimes Y[q]
$$</div>

<p>where the sum is indexed over all tuples $p,q$ such that $p+q=n$. It can be shown that the Cauchy product $(X\cdot Y)_\bullet$ of two combinatorial species is the <a href="">Day convolution</a> inherited by the “sum and shuffle” monoidal structure on $\bf P$.</p>

<p>(Exercise: how do you use the sum and shuffle product and the equivariant product to interpret the $\otimes$ sign?)</p>

<p>The last and more important monoidal structure with which the category of species is endowed is called the <em>substitution</em> monoidal structure, and its definition resembles the one given for $[{\bf Fin},{\bf Set}]$ in <a href="">lecture 1</a>.</p>

<p>On generating series, this operation should correspond to <em>functional substitution</em>: the operation that given two formal power series $f = \sum a_n t^n,g = \sum b_m t^m \in K\llbracket t\rrbracket$, defines the series $f[g](t)$ as the one obtained by formally unwinding the expression</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
a_0 + a_1 g(t) + a_2 (g(t) \cdot g(t)) + \dots
$$</div>

<p>(<em>Exercise</em>. Find an explicit expression for $[t^n](f[g])$ in terms of the $a_n, b_m$’s.)</p>

<p>But one must be careful, as this relation is true for generating species but <em>not</em> for type generating species. For example, this is true for the species of permutation $\cal S$, which is equal to the substitution of the species $\cal C$ of cycles into the species $E$ of sets. For the species $\cal S$, the type generating series is $\dots$, whereas for the substitution $E\triangleleft \cal C$ the type generating series is $\dots$.</p>

<p>The formula for the type generating series of a substitution $F\triangleleft G$ involves the <em>cycle index series</em>…</p>

<p>In lesson 1 we have seen how the category $[{\bf Fin}, {\bf Set}]$ inherits a (non strict) monoidal structure, called the <em>substitution product</em>: the substitution of a pair of functors $M,N : {\bf Fin}\to{\bf Set}$ is the functor</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
[n] \mapsto M \triangleleft N := (\text{Lan}_J M \circ \text{Lan}_J N) \circ J = \text{Lan}_J M \circ N
$$</div>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The substitution monoidal structure). Given two combinatorial species we can define their substitution product as follows:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F \triangleleft G := \lambda m . \int^{n,k_1,\dots,k_n} F(n) \times Gk_1\times \dots \times Gk_n \times {\bf P}(m, k_1+\dots+k_n).
$$</div>

<p>The structure exists for a similar reason than the case of $\bf Fin$: the left Kan extension of a functor $X : {\bf P} \to {\bf Set}$ along the (nonfull) inclusion $j : {\bf P} \to {\bf Set}$ yields an equivalence between $\bf Spc$ and a monoidal subcategory of $[{\bf Set},{\bf Set}]$ (it is not immediate how to characterise it because in this case the inclusion functor $j : {\bf P} \to {\bf Set}$ is not full).</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Given a combinatorial species $G$, define $G^{\ast 1}:=G$ and $G^{\ast (n+1)} := G \ast G^{\ast n}$. Find an explicit formula for the functor $G^{\ast n}$ using a suitable coend, and show that the substitution product admits the more concise formula</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F\triangleleft G := \lambda m.\int^n Fn \times G^{\ast n}(m)
$$</div>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Given two formal power series $f,g \in K\llbracket t\rrbracket$, find an explicit formula for the coefficient $c_n$ of degree $n$ in the series $f[g](t)$. (Is it possible to “decategorify” the above expression for $F\triangleleft G$, given that if $f,g$ are the generating series of $F,G$ respectively, then $c_n$ is the cardinality of $F\triangleleft G$?)</p>
<h3 id="on-the-structure-of-bf-spc-as-a-topos">On the structure of $\bf Spc$ as a topos</h3>

<p>The following subsection is of no particular interest for us, but the category of species happens to be a (Grothendieck) topos, and I haven’t been able to find any source investigating the consequences of this fact (or even describing this structure, at least to some extent). Thus I find a nice exercise in style to fill the gap.</p>

<p>This said: on top of all of the structure mentioned above, the category of species, i.e. functors ${\bf P}^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$ has very nice properties of a completely different kind; it is a <em>Grothendieck topos</em> (or shortly, just a <em>topos</em>).</p>

<p>In short, a Grothendieck topos is a category $\cal E$ where “the usual kind of Mathematics can be enacted” (at the price of doing so <em>constructively</em>).</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the class of categories embodying such a powerful language can be axiomatised pretty concisely: a topos is a category $\cal E$</p>

<ol>
  <li>admitting all finite limits;</li>
  <li>that is <em>cartesian closed</em>, meaning that there is a natural bijection
<span class="kdmath">${\cal E}(A\times B, C) \cong {\cal E}(A, C^B)$</span>
for every three objects $A,B,C$</li>
  <li>having a <em>subobject classifier</em>, meaning an object $\Omega$ with the property that for every $A\in\cal E$ the poset of all subobjects of $A$ is parametrised by the set of morphisms into a fixed object $\Omega$ that thus “classifies” monomorphisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unwinding axiom 3, it means the following: there exists a unique monomorphism $\tau : 1 \to \Omega$ with the property that <em>every</em> monomorphism $m : U \to A$ into <em>every</em> object $A\in \cal E$ appears in a pullback square</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.001ex 0.112ex -9.832ex 0.0ex; height: 11.535ex; width: 14.461ex;' src="/species/antex/c816bb5f08d4a167f3b11e500e003aee.svg" /></span></p>

<p>of $\tau$ along a unique $\chi_A : A \to \Omega$.</p>

<p>This request translates diagrammatically the request that every subset $X\hookrightarrow A$ has a “characteristic function” $\chi_X : A \to \Omega$ such that $\chi_X(a)=1$ if and only if $a\in X$.</p>

<p>The meat is in the third axiom: having a subobject classifier is a powerful property for a category (familiar categories like groups, vector spaces, and $\bf Cat$ (categories and functor) cannot have one; prove it as an exercise.)</p>

<p>The following facts do not add much depth to the following discussion, so we leave them as highly optional exercises; the only reason to engage with them is if you have never seen how both statements can be proved in fair generality</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em> (The cartesian closure of $\bf Spc$). Show that the category of combinatorial species is <em>cartesian closed</em>, as a consequence of the following general fact.</p>

<p>Let ${\cal C}^\lor = [\mathcal{C}, {\bf Set}]$ be the category of functors $F : {\cal C} \to {\bf Set}$. Show that there is a natural bijection</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
{\cal C}^\lor(F\times G, H) \cong {\cal C}^\lor(F, H^G) \cong {\cal C}^\lor(G, H^F)
$$</div>

<p>where $F\times G$ is the product $C\mapsto FC\times GC$, and $H^G : {\cal C}^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$ is the “internal hom” between $G$ and $H$.</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em> (The subobject classifier of $\bf Spc$). Show that the category of combinatorial species is <em>cartesian closed</em>, as a consequence of the following general fact.</p>

<p>Let ${\cal C}^\lor = [\mathcal{C}, {\bf Set}]$ be the category of functors $F : {\cal C} \to {\bf Set}$. Show that the following position defines a subobject classifier $\Omega$ for ${\cal C}^\lor$.</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\Omega : C\mapsto \text{Sub}_{\cal C}(\text{よ}C) = \{R \hookrightarrow \text{よ}C \}
$$</div>

<p>(in simple words: $C$ goes to the set of isomorphism classes of monics with codomain $\text{よ}C$, the representable functor on $C$).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Characterise $\text{よ}(n)={\bf P}(n, -)$ in the case of species;</li>
  <li>Specialise the above definition to $\mathcal C = \bf P$: who is $\Omega$ in this case (remember that the map $R \to \text{よ}(n)$ muts be a <em>natural transformation</em>, not just a collection of components: what constraint does this condition pose on $R$?)</li>
</ol>
