    <h1>Monoidal Structures on $\bf P$</h1>
    <p>A fundamental tenet of categorical combinatorics is that the richness of the objects it tries to study comes from the synergy between many different structures one can equip the categories $\bf P$ and $\bf Spc$ with.</p>

<h3 id="monoidal-structure-on-bf-p-and-bf-spc">Monoidal structure on $\bf P$ and $\bf Spc$</h3>

<p>In particular, there are three distinct <em>monoidal structures</em> on the category of species, all of which have a quite natural combinatorial interpretation. One of them is the most important for us, because it is induced on $\bf Spc$ by a natural choice of a monoidal product on $\bf P$. The monoidal structure on $\bf P$ is essentially determined by the disjoint sum of finite set: in a skeleton for $\bf P$, $[n]\cup [m] = [n+m]$. This induces a <em>convolution</em> operation on $\bf Spc$, by a renowned construction due to Brian Day.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The “sum and shuffle” product on $\bf P$). The “sum and shuffle” monoidal structure $\oplus$ on $\bf P$ is the bifunctor $\_\oplus_ : {\bf P} \times {\bf P} \to \bf P$ defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on objects, $[n]\oplus [m]$ is just the set $[n+m]$;</li>
  <li>on morphisms, let’s say $\sigma : [n] \to [n]$ and $\eta [m] \to [m]$ are two bijections, the bijection $∑ \oplus \eta$ is defined as a “shuffle permutation”, namely</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sigma \oplus \eta : i \mapsto \begin{cases} \sigma i & \text{ if } 1 \le i \le  n \\ \eta(i-n) & \text{ if } n+1 \le i \le n+m \end{cases}
$$</div>

<p>In simple terms, this means that a permutation of $n$ elements and a permutation of $m$ elements act “in parallel” on a set with $n+m$ elements. (Exercise: write $\sigma \oplus \eta : [6] \to [6]$ when $n=m=3$, $\sigma = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\eta = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The Cartesian monoidal structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>Cartesian product</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \times Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto X[n] \times Y[n]
$$</div>

<p>It can be easily checked that $(X\times Y)_\bullet$ is the binary product bifunctor in $\bf Spc$. (Evidently: because limits, and a fortiori products, in a category of functors, are compute pointwise.)</p>

<p>In terms of their formal power series representation, the product corresponds to the pointwise (or “Hadamard”) product of formal power series: given $f,g : \mathbb N \llbracket t\rrbracket$, $f\times g$ is the series</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (f_ng_n) t^n.
$$</div>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The coCartesian structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>coproduct</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \cup Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto X[n] \cup Y[n]
$$</div>

<p>where $\cup$ denotes disjoint union of sets. It can be easily checked that $(X\cup Y)_\bullet$ is the binary coproduct bifunctor in $\bf Spc$. (Evidently: because colimits, and a fortiori coproducts, in a category of functors, are compute pointwise.)</p>

<p>In terms of their formal power series representation, the product corresponds to the plain <em>sum</em> of formal power series.</p>

<p>In order to introduce the next construction we need the following definition: let $X,Y$ be two sets on which a group $G$ is acting, respectively on the right and on the left.</p>

<p>We define the <em>equivariant product</em> $X\otimes_G Y$ of $X$ and $Y$ to be the set obtained as the coequaliser of the pair of maps</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.021ex 0.115ex -3.658ex 0.0ex; height: 7.679ex; width: 49.225ex;' src="/species/antex/f3efa0c778769de945df615a078313c2.svg" /></span></p>

<p>where $\alpha : X \times G \to X$ and $\beta : G \times Y \to Y$ are the actions.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The Cauchy monoidal structure). Given two species $X_\bullet,Y_\bullet$, their <em>Cauchy product</em> is the species</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(X \cdot Y)_\bullet : [n] \mapsto \sum_{p+q=n} X[p] \otimes Y[q]
$$</div>

<p>where the sum is indexed over all tuples $p,q$ such that $p+q=n$. It can be shown that the Cauchy product $(X\cdot Y)_\bullet$ of two combinatorial species is the <a href="">Day convolution</a> inherited by the “sum and shuffle” monoidal structure on $\bf P$.</p>

<p>(Exercise: how do you use the sum and shuffle product and the equivariant product to interpret the $\otimes$ sign?)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> (The substitution monoidal structure).</p>

<h3 id="on-the-structure-of-bf-spc-as-a-topos">On the structure of $\bf Spc$ as a topos</h3>

<p>On top of all of this structure, the category of species, i.e. functors ${\bf P}^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$ has very nice properties of a completely different kind: it is a <em>Grothendieck topos</em> (or shortly, just a <em>topos</em>).</p>

<p>In short, a Grothendieck topos is a category $\cal E$ where “the usual kind of Mathematics can be enacted” (at the price of doing so <em>constructively</em>).</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the class of categories embodying such a powerful language can be axiomatised pretty concisely: a topos is a category $\cal E$</p>

<ol>
  <li>admitting all finite limits;</li>
  <li>that is <em>cartesian closed</em>, meaning that there is a natural bijection
<span class="kdmath">${\cal E}(A\times B, C) \cong {\cal E}(A, C^B)$</span>
for every three objects $A,B,C$</li>
  <li>having a <em>subobject classifier</em>, meaning an object $\Omega$ with the property that for every $A\in\cal E$ the poset of all subobjects of $A$ is parametrized by the set of morphisms into a fixed object $\Omega$ that thus “classifies” monomorphisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unwinding axiom 3, it means the following: there exists a unique monomorphism $\tau : 1 \to \Omega$ with the property that <em>every</em> monomorphism $m : U \to A$ into <em>every</em> object $A\in \cal E$ appears in a pullback square</p>

<p><span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.001ex 0.112ex -9.832ex 0.0ex; height: 11.535ex; width: 14.461ex;' src="/species/antex/c816bb5f08d4a167f3b11e500e003aee.svg" /></span></p>

<p>of $\tau$ along a unique $\chi_A : A \to \Omega$.</p>

<p>This request translates diagrammatically the request that every subset $X\hookrightarrow A$ has a “characteristic function” $\chi_X : A \to \Omega$ such that $\chi_X(a)=1$ if and only if $a\in X$.</p>

<p>The meat is in the third axiom: having a subobject classifier is an extremely strong property for a category (familiar categories like groups, vector spaces, and $\bf Cat$ (categories and functor) can’t have one; prove it as an exercise.)</p>
