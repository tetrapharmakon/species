abstract = {Using his theory of combinatorial species, Andre Joyal proved in Advan. in Math. 42 (1981), 1–82 a combinatorial form of the classical multidimensional implicit function theorem. His theorem asserts the existence and (strong) unicity of species satisgying systems of combinatorial equations of a very general type. We present an explicit construction of these species by using a suitable combinatorial version of the Lie Series in the sense of W. Grobner (“Die Lie-Reihen und ihre Anwendungen,” D. Verlag d. Wiss., Berlin, 1967; “Contributions to the theory of Lie Series,” Bibliographisches Institut — Mannheim, Hochschultaschenbucher, Mannheim, 1967). The approach constitutes a generalization of the method of “eclosions” (bloomings) which was used by the author in (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 39, No. 1 (1985), 52–82), to study multidimensional power series reversion. Remarks concerning the applicability of the method to solve certain combinatorial differential equations are also made at the end of the work.},

abstract = {A given structure is said to be asymmetric if its automorphism group reduces to the identity. The problem of enumerating asymmetric structures (and, more generally, to count structures according to stabilizers) is usually solved by making use of Mobius inversion techniques and symmetric functions in the context of group actions. This method of solution was introduced by Rota (1964, 1969) who defined special classes of polynomials which may be called asymmetry indicator polynomials. Subsequent developments following similar ideas can be found in Stockmeyer (1971), White (1975), Rota, Smith and Sagan (1977, 1980), Kerber (1986). We present here another approach to this problem within the theory of species of structures in the sense of Joyal (1981, 1985, 1986). Every species of structures F contains a sub-species F, called the flat part of F, consisting of all asymmetric F-structures. We introduce an asymmetry indicator series ΓF(x1, x2, x3,…) by means of which we study the correspondence F↦F in connection with the various operations existing in the theory of species of structures. The main result is that the ΓF behaves with respect to the combinatorial operations of sum, product, substitution and differentiation as does the classical cycle indicator series ZF. As a consequence, the asymmetry indicator series can be applied to the systematic classification and enumeration of asymmetric F-structures when the species F is defined (explicitly or recursively) by combinatorial equations. We illustrate the method on particular species (including enriched trees and rooted trees) and a table of ΓF is given for the atomic species concentrated on small cardinalities. Examples show that ΓF contains information independent of that in ZF.},

This bijection extends to a ring isomorphism between B(Sn) (the Burnside ring of the symmetric group) and the ring V S n (of virtual species of degree n).Since permutation groups are well known (and often studied using computers) this helps in finding examples and counterexamples in species. The cycle index series of a molecular species, which is hard to compute directly, is proved to be simply the (Polya) cycle polynomial of the corresponding permutation group. Conversely, several operations which are hard to define in ΠnB(Sn) have a natural description in terms of species. Both situations are extended to coefficients in λ-rings and binomial rings in the last section.},

abstract = {Abstract Let f = f(x) = x + a2x2 + … ∈ K[[x]] be a “normalized” power series over a (commutative) field K of characteristic zero. The operator Δf: K[[x]] → K[[x]], defined by Δfg = g ∘ f − g, has been used in ( G. Labelle, European J. Combin. 1 (1980) , 113–138) to obtain formulas for the inverse f〈−1〉 and the generalized iterates f〈t〉, t ∈ K, of the series f. A. Joyal (in Lect. Notes in Math. Vol. 1234, pp. 126–159, Springer-Verlag, New York/Berlin, 1986 ) was the first to realize that Δf can be lifted to the combinatorial level. He made use of this fact to obtain a formula for a virtual species F〈−1〉 which is the inverse (under substitution) of any given normalized species F = X + …. Using the same operator, we show that the concept of K -species in the sense of Y.-N. Yeh (ibid.) (where K is now only a binomial half-ring) is a good context for the definition of the generalized iterates F〈t〉, t ∈ K, of any normalized species (or K -species). We present a new approach to Yeh's extension of substitution to K -species. We also introduce the notions of “infinitesimal generator,” “directional derivatives,” and “Lie bracket” of K -species, which turn out to be K -species, where K denotes the “rational closure” of K . These concepts give, in return, a better insight into substitution itself. For example, G ∘ F can be written in the form G ∘ F = (exp DΦ)G for a suitably chosen derivation DΦ. More generally, G ∘ F〈t〉 = (exp tDΦ)G. Two normalized K -species commute under substitution if and only if the Lie bracket of their infinitesimal generators is zero. Explicitly computed examples are also given.},

The theory of species shows the internal structure of the classical algebric manipulations and synthetizes a long development into the description of a certain class of arborescences. This approach is particularly efficient for the design of computer algebra algorithms. There are new developments in this direction. Classical developments on implicit polynomial differential equations are also possible.},

Labelle) of Lagrange's inversion formula. Polya's enumeration theory of isomorphism classes of structures is entirely renewed. Recursive methods for computing cycle index polynomials are described. A combinatorial version of the implicit function theorem is stated and proved. The paper ends with general considerations on the use of coalgebras in combinatorics.},

abstract = {The original Lagrange inversion formula, which gives explicitly the inverse under composition of a formal series, was obtained by Lagrange in 1770 through formal computations involving logarithms of inlmite products. See Lagrange [ 121. There exists an extensive literature on various versions of the inversion formula obtained by algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial methods. Comtet [3] gives a survey and an ample bibliography. During the last ten years there have appeared several papers on generalizations and new proofs of the inversion formula. In 1974 Abhyankar obtained an inversion formula using algebraic methods. See Bass, Connell, and Wright [ 11. Several authors have related Lagrange inversion with Rota’s Finite Operator Calculus [ 151, for example, Joni [8], Garsia and Joni [4], Hofhauer [7], and Roman and Rota [14]. Joyal and Labelle used a combinatorial theory of formal series to obtain inversion formulas (see [9-l I] ) and Viskov [ 161 used ideas from Lie algebra theory to prove formulas similar to Abhyankar’s. In the present paper we use operator methods to obtain inversion formulas in several variables that generalize the formulas of Abhyankar, Joni, and Viskov. We get our results studying an algebra with involution of linear operators on the algebra of formal Laurent series in several indeterminates. We also show that by means of an anti-isomorphism of operator algebras, which we call the operator Bore1 transform, the study of finite operator calculus can be reduced to the study of certain groups of operators on the algebra of formal Laurent series. Our approach may be considered as an algebraic analogue of the complex variable methods used by Good [5] to obtain the Lagrange inversion formula as a consequence of the change of variables theorem for the},

abstract = {Recently, two of the authors have introduced a combinatorial resolution of systems of forced differential equations [8,9,10]. In particular this approach allows to obtain a formal expansion for these equations with a richer structure than the Fliess generating power series [4]. In this paper we obtain approximations by imposing a bound p on the possible widths of trees and hedges. We show that these approximants satisfy a bilinear system and possess the same Volterra kernels as the exact solution, up to order p. They are in fact equivalent to approximants introduced by Brockett [1] using a truncated Carleman linearization [2]. Recall that using these approximations, Krener has shown then that a nonlinear system with control entering linearly is locally almost bilinear [7]. Besides the mathematical interest, the relevance of this combinatorial approach is that it provides a clear iterative scheme in order to find the functional expansion of the solution and that it should lead to efficient computer tools for analyzing the behavior of the solution around equilibrium points.},
