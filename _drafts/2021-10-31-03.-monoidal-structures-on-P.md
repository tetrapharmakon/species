### Monoidal structure on $\bf P$

A fundamental tenet of categorical combinatorics is that the richness of the objects it tries to study comes from the synergy between many different structures one can equip the categories $\bf P$ and $\bf Spc$ with.

In particular, there are three distinct *monoidal structures* on the category of species, all of which have a quite natural combinatorial interpretation.

First of all, the category of species, i.e. functors ${\bf P}^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$ form a category with very nice properties, called a *Grothendieck topos* (or shortly, just a *topos*): in short, a Grothendieck topos is a category $\cal E$ where "the usual kind of Mathematics can be enacted" (at the price of doing so *constructively*).

Somewhat surprisingly, the clas of categories embodying such a powerful language can be axiomatised pretty concisely: a topos is a category $\cal E$ 

1. admitting all finite limits;
2. that is *cartesian closed*, meaning that there is a natural bijection 
   $$ {\cal E}(A\times B, C) \cong {\cal E}(A, C^B) $$
   for every three objects $A,B,C$
3. having a *subobject classifier*, meaning an object $\Omega$ with the property that for every $A\in\cal E$ the poset of all subobjects of $A$ is parametrized by 

This request translates diagrammatically the request that every subset $X\hookrightarrow A$ has a "characteristic function" $\chi_X : A \to \Omega$ such that $\chi_X(a)=1$ if and only if $a\in X$.

The meat is in the third axiom: having a subobject classifier is an extremely strong property for a category (familiar categories like groups, vector spaces, and categories-and-functor can't have one; prove it as an exercise.)
